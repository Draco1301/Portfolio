## Overview of ML
You can find a link to the document [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration
In this assignment I programmed a simple [script](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Source.cpp) to find the mean, median, range, correlation and covariance. More information about the topic can be found [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.docx) 

##  Linear Models
Francisco Trejo and I have made linear models that can be viewd [here(Regression)](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Classification.pdf) and [here(Classification)](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Regression.pdf)


## Linear Regression & Naive Bayes in C++ from Scratch
I implemented the [linear regression](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression.cpp) & [naive bayes](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/NaiveBayes.cpp) algorithm from scratch to calculate the probability of both survival on the [Titanic](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/titanic_project.csv). more about this can be read [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch.pdf)
