## Intro to Machine Learning Portfolio

<center> This is my portfolio for my assignments from my intro to machine learning class </center>

1. **Overview of Machine Learning :** You can find a link to the document [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)

2. **Data Exploration :** In this assignment I programmed a simple [script](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Source.cpp) to find the mean, median, range, correlation, and covariance. More information about the topic can be found [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.docx) 

3. **Linear Models :** Francisco Trejo and I have made linear models that can be viewed [here(Regression)](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Classification.pdf) and [here(Classification)](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Regression.pdf)

4. **Linear Regression & Naive Bayes in C++ from Scratch :** I implemented the [linear regression](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression.cpp) & [naive bayes](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/NaiveBayes.cpp) algorithm from scratch to calculate the probability of both survival on the [Titanic](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/titanic_project.csv). more about this can be read [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch.pdf)

5. **Searching for Similarity - Regression :** I created multiple different regression models that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/SFSRegression.pdf)

6. **Python ML with sklearn :** In this assignment, I created multiple machine learning models in Python and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20with%20sklearn.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf)

7. **Image Classification with Deep Learning :** In this [project](https://github.com/Draco1301/Sample_Portfolio/blob/main/Image%20Classification%20with%20DL.pdf), I attempted to create a deep-learning AI to recognize each type of playing card.

## Personal Projects Portfolio
1. **[Asteroid Rush](https://diego-ochoa.itch.io/asteroid-rush) :** A game I made for <u>Games Scripting I</u> in about a week. It's a top-down shooter where you must protect the mothership for as long as you can from asteroids with various upgrades.

2. **Wave Function Collapse Art :** An art piece generator that uses the wave function collapse algorithm to create a top-down 2D pixel landscape. 

3.  **[Genetic Algorithm Path Finder](https://diego-ochoa.itch.io/genetic-algoithm) :** A very simple genetic algorithm AI that solves a path you create for it. It is a very simple AI and takes a long time depending on the track but will eventually solve it.
4. **Raycast Engine Game :** I created a raycast engine in Java for my computer graphics class. Includes multiple textures, objects, and enemies to avoid.
